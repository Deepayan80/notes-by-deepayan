                <p>
                    The <b>Economic Survey 2025–26</b> presents a picture of an Indian economy that is resilient,
                    broad-based, and structurally stronger—even as global uncertainties continue to cast long shadows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From industry and services to fiscal discipline and data reforms, FY26 emerges as a year where
                    domestic fundamentals quietly did the heavy lifting.
                </p>

                <h3>Industrial Growth: Manufacturing Takes the Lead</h3>

                <p>
                    Industrial activity gained momentum in the first half of FY26, growing <b>7%</b>, outperforming both
                    last year and pre-COVID trends. The standout performer was manufacturing, which expanded by
                    <b>8.4%</b>, supported by robust demand and improved capacity utilisation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Importantly, utilisation levels stayed above long-term averages—an indicator that growth is not just
                    cyclical, but capacity-backed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Construction also remained resilient, growing <b>7.4%</b>, driven by sustained public capital
                    expenditure and ongoing infrastructure projects. Even weather-related disruptions could not derail
                    momentum. Mining was the only laggard, contracting modestly due to excessive rainfall, while
                    utilities grew at a slower pace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    High-frequency indicators—PMI manufacturing, IIP, and e-way bill generation—reinforce this
                    narrative. Together, they point to a strengthening industrial cycle supported by GST
                    rationalisation and a favourable demand outlook.
                </p>

                <h3>Services: The Economy’s Stabilising Anchor</h3>

                <p>
                    If industry provided momentum, services provided stability. The services sector is estimated to
                    have grown <b>9.1%</b> in FY26, accelerating sharply from FY25.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Its share in GDP rose to <b>53.6%</b>, underlining its role as the backbone of India’s growth story.
                    Most service sub-sectors recorded growth above 9%, including financial services, real estate,
                    professional services, and public administration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The only segment still catching up to its pre-pandemic average is trade, hospitality, and transport,
                    though even here, the gap has narrowed significantly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    High-frequency indicators such as PMI Services, port traffic, railway freight, and air cargo suggest
                    that momentum is continuing into the second half of the year, despite temporary moderation caused
                    by cost pressures and geopolitical disruptions.
                </p>

                <h3>Nowcasting GDP: Reading the Economy in Real Time</h3>

                <p>
                    One of the more important developments highlighted in the Survey is the use of <b>nowcasting
                        models</b>. Because official GDP numbers arrive with a lag, policymakers increasingly rely on
                    high-frequency indicators to assess real-time economic conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using a Dynamic Factor Model and an ARIMAX framework, the Survey’s nowcasting exercise estimates
                    real GDP growth of around <b>7%</b> for Q3 FY26—signalling a shift toward data-driven policymaking.
                </p>

                <h3>Strengthening India’s Statistical Backbone</h3>

                <p>
                    Behind better policy lies better data. The Survey outlines a major upgrade of India’s National
                    Statistical System. New surveys like ASISSE, the upcoming Household Income Survey, and more
                    frequent PLFS releases aim to close long-standing data gaps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Major rebasing exercises are underway:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>GDP and IIP rebased to <b>2022–23</b></li>
                    <li>CPI rebased to <b>2024</b>, reflecting updated consumption patterns</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These changes promise more accurate inflation measurement, better regional allocation of activity,
                    and improved coverage of the informal sector.
                </p>

                <h3>Inflation: Cooling Without Crippling Growth</h3>

                <p>
                    FY26 witnessed a sharp easing of inflation. Headline CPI fell to <b>1.7%</b>, driven largely by food
                    price corrections, favourable agricultural conditions, and supply-side interventions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adjusted for volatile precious metals, core inflation pressures appear muted—suggesting limited
                    demand overheating and improved real purchasing power.
                </p>

                <h3>Fiscal Discipline Meets Public Investment</h3>

                <p>
                    India’s fiscal strategy in FY26 strikes a careful balance: <b>consolidation without contraction</b>.
                    Tax collections remained resilient, GST recorded multiple all-time highs, and capital expenditure
                    surged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Capital spending now accounts for over <b>22%</b> of total central government expenditure. Markets
                    have responded positively—sovereign bond yields have eased, borrowing costs have declined, and
                    India received multiple sovereign rating upgrades.
                </p>

                <h3>Monetary Transmission and Credit Dynamics</h3>

                <p>
                    With inflation under control, monetary policy turned accommodative. Since February 2025, the repo
                    rate has been cut by <b>125 basis points</b>, supported by liquidity injections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lending rates declined, bank balance sheets strengthened, and NPAs fell to multi-decade lows.
                    Meanwhile, large firms increasingly tapped non-bank and market-based financing.
                </p>

                <h3>External Sector: Stable, but Not Without Headwinds</h3>

                <p>
                    India’s exports crossed a record <b>USD 825 billion</b> in FY25, with services exports and
                    remittances cushioning global trade disruptions. The current account deficit remained manageable
                    at <b>0.8% of GDP</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite currency pressures and volatile portfolio flows, forex reserves remain strong—covering
                    over <b>11 months of imports</b>.
                </p>

                <h3>Labour Markets and Social Progress</h3>

                <p>
                    Labour market indicators show gradual improvement. Unemployment has declined, participation has
                    stabilised, and new labour codes aim to improve flexibility and social security—especially for gig
                    workers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Poverty levels have declined under revised benchmarks, while health and education indicators
                    continue to improve, reinforcing inclusive growth.
                </p>

                <h3>Outlook: Cautious Optimism</h3>

                <p>
                    The Survey projects FY27 GDP growth between <b>6.8% and 7.2%</b>. Global risks remain real, but
                    India enters this phase with low inflation, healthier balance sheets, strong public investment, and
                    rising medium-term growth potential close to <b>7%</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Bottom line:</b> steady reforms, credible policy, and strong domestic fundamentals have placed
                    India on a durable growth path—one that requires vigilance, not pessimism.
