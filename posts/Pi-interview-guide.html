                <p>
                    Hey everyone, today I am going to share how you can prepare for a PI interview.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wait—why would you listen to me? What experience do I really have? I have zero full-time work
                    experience and have only given a few interviews during placements. When it comes to MBA interviews,
                    I am as new as you can imagine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, based on my past corporate interview experiences and guidance from seniors at IIMs, I have
                    been preparing seriously for PI interviews. I am simply sharing my learnings, which might help you
                    as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, I will cover some important HR questions that are commonly asked in IIM interviews—although
                    the sky is the limit.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Tell Me About Yourself</h3>

                <p>
                    This is the most important question and almost always asked. If 10 interviews are conducted, there
                    is a very high chance that this question will come up in 9 of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although it seems easy, this question decides the flow of your entire interview. Structuring it
                    properly is extremely important.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A good structure is: academics → projects / positions of responsibility / certifications → a brief
                    hint of why you decided to pursue an MBA (do not explain it in detail here).
                </p>

                <p><b>Sample Answer (Fresher – Engineer)</b></p>

                <p>
                    Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity. My name is Deepayan Das.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I come from a technical background. I completed my Diploma in Electronics and Telecommunication
                    Engineering from XYZ Polytechnic, followed by a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering
                    from XYZ Institute. These experiences gave me a strong practical foundation and a disciplined
                    problem-solving approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my engineering, I realized that I perform best in challenging situations. A key example was
                    my final-year project on a 15-volt current sense circuit. Just before submission, one of our core
                    team members met with an accident. I had to quickly assess the situation, redistribute
                    responsibilities, and take ownership of critical tasks to ensure we delivered a working prototype
                    within the deadline. This experience taught me leadership, accountability, and decision-making under
                    pressure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I enjoy technical work and validated my aptitude by clearing GATE, I gradually understood
                    that my long-term interest lies in managing people, resources, and decisions rather than working only
                    at a technical level. I want to build the skills required to solve larger, real-world problems and
                    create meaningful impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside academics, I enjoy long evening walks and playing video games. These activities help me stay
                    calm, focused, and mentally balanced, which I believe are important qualities for leadership roles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Note: Don’t copy hobbies or positions of responsibility unless you have genuinely done them.
                        Saying anything false can lead to traps and grilling.</i>
                </p>

                <h3>2. Why MBA?</h3>

                <p>
                    I am not providing a sample answer here because everyone’s background, goals, and aspirations are
                    different.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your answer should clearly cover: where you are currently, what skills you have, what skills you
                    lack, where you want to see yourself in the future, and how an MBA will help you bridge that gap.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Gap Year Question</h3>

                <p>
                    If you have a gap year, this question will almost certainly come up. Do not highlight it yourself,
                    but if the panel asks, do not deny it. Explain it honestly and logically.
                </p>

                <p><b>Sample Answer (Fresher – Engineer)</b></p>

                <p>
                    After completing my B.Tech, I wanted to make a well-informed decision about my long-term career
                    rather than rushing into the next step. I prepared for and appeared in GATE to objectively assess my
                    technical strength and career inclination.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The experience helped me realize that while I can handle technical problem-solving, a purely
                    technical or research-intensive career is not where I see myself creating long-term impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During this phase, I explored management as a career option and realized that decision-making,
                    coordination, and accountability aligned more closely with my interests. Due to a broader hiring
                    slowdown, I could not secure a role that matched my learning goals, so I used this time to gain
                    clarity and prepare seriously for CAT.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My gap year was a conscious transition phase that helped me make a deliberate shift toward
                    management.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Note: Don’t copy-paste unless it genuinely matches your journey.</i>
                </p>

                <h3>4. Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>

                <p>
                    At this stage, you should be aware of your strengths and weaknesses. Mention at least two strengths
                    and clearly explain how you are working to improve your weaknesses.
                </p>

                <h3>5. If Not Selected Here, Then What?</h3>

                <p>
                    Even if you have other calls, avoid saying you will simply join another college. Show why this
                    institute matters to you.
                </p>

                <p><b>Sample Answer</b></p>

                <p>
                    XYZ is my clear first preference, and I have prepared specifically with this institute in mind. I am
                    not looking for just an MBA tag but the right environment to grow, and for me, that environment is
                    XYZ.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Tell Me About Your Hometown</h3>

                <p>
                    Keep it brief: city or village, state, and a short economic or cultural context. If the panel wants
                    more, they will ask.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Tell Me Something Not in Your Resume</h3>

                <p>
                    You can share a habit, challenge, or mindset that shaped you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing not explicitly mentioned in my resume is how intentionally I work on self-discipline and
                    consistency. I focus on building daily systems rather than relying on motivation, which helps me
                    stay composed under pressure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Blind copying can be as fatal as Chatur’s speech in <b>3 Idiots</b>. Understanding your own story
                        and sharing it honestly will always be a boon.</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    That’s all for today. Do share this with your friends who have their PI interviews coming up.
                </p>
