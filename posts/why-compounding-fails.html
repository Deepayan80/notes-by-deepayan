                    Compounding is simple to understand, yet painfully hard to practice.
                    Most people fail not because they don’t know the math, but because they
                    underestimate time and overestimate discipline.

                <p>
                    The real enemy of compounding is impatience. We want results now, not
                    ten years later. This bias quietly destroys long-term outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wealth, like character, grows slowly. Almost invisibly.
